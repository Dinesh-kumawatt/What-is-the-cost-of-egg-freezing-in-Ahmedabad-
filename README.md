# What-is-the-cost-of-egg-freezing-in-Ahmedabad-

Egg freezing is becoming more popular, especially among women who want to preserve their fertility for later. But many people are confused about how much it costs, what’s included, and if it’s worth doing. In Ahmedabad, the cost of egg freezing can vary depending on the hospital or clinic, the type of medications used, and how many cycles are needed.

On average, the cost of one egg freezing cycle in Ahmedabad ranges between ₹80,000 to ₹1.5 lakhs. This includes ovarian stimulation injections, ultrasound scans, blood tests, egg retrieval, and freezing (cryopreservation). But this doesn’t include the yearly storage charges, which are usually ₹10,000 to ₹20,000 per year.

Some clinics may offer packages that cover multiple cycles or include storage for a year or two. It's a good idea to ask clearly what’s included so you don’t get surprised later with extra charges.

The cost also depends on how your body responds. For example, if your ovaries don’t produce enough eggs in one cycle, your doctor may suggest doing another round, which will increase the total cost.

Here’s a simple breakdown of what affects the cost:

Doctor fees & consultation

Ovarian stimulation injections (these are often expensive)

Monitoring (ultrasound + blood tests)

Egg retrieval procedure

Lab charges for freezing

Storage charges (monthly or yearly)

Egg freezing is a personal decision, and while it’s not cheap, many women feel it gives them peace of mind. It’s useful for:

Career planning

Delaying pregnancy for personal or medical reasons

Before cancer treatment or other therapies that may affect fertility

Women with low AMH or early signs of menopause

It's important to do egg freezing at a place where the embryology lab is good, the success rate is high, and the doctors guide you properly. Just freezing eggs is not enough – the quality of freezing and thawing also matters when you decide to use them later.
